# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Northern red oak (*Quercus rubra*) is predicted to expand its range northward in the northeastern United States with climate change and could greatly improve forest resilience by expanding the functional diversity of its new habitats. However, red oak regeneration currently faces many challenges including predation, pathogens, and consequences of forest mesophication such as light insufficiency and competition with more mesic species. The latter challenges are potentially caused by the absence of fire in forested landscapes since the early 1900s. Therefore, prescribed burns may help address these challenges and hence promote oak establishment and recruitment. We studied six prescribed burn/unburn pairs of stands from across the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, most of which were managed over the past decade, plus one unmanaged stand where a wildfire occurred. In summers 2023 and 2024, we surveyed naturally regenerated oak seedlings along transects representing gradients of burn intensity, distance from edge, overstory density, and soil disturbance. Seedlings were aged, measured for height and diameter at root collar, and assessed for herbivory and pathogen damage. We found seedling density to be three times greater in prescribed burn stands relative to their paired unburn controls. Seedlings in burned stands also grew better, evidenced by greater diameter at root collar, greater extension growth, and more sprouted leaves. Our study demonstrates positive effects for red oak regeneration near its northern range limit in North America and affirms prescribed fire as a potentially beneficial silvicultural management tool in introducing the species north of its current distribution.

# Introduction

Northern red oak (*Quercus rubra* L.) is an economically and ecologically important tree species in the northeastern United States. It is a fast-growing species and thrives on a wide range of upland soils [@abramsFireDevelopmentOak1992]. Additionally, it is tolerant of heat, drought [@coble2017; @asbjornsen2021], and ground fire [@abramsFireEcologicalHistory2000]. *Q. rubra* produces high-quality timber with high wood density, making it an important lumber commodity and prompting forest managers to be concerned with its sustainable regeneration [@deyReviewDynamicsPrescribed2018]. *Q. rubra* is managed for other ecological values as well. For example, it serves as a habitat and food source for many wildlife species, from birds like turkeys and jays to mammals like mice, squirrels, and deer, and even insects like weevils [@mcsheaForestryMattersDecline2007]. Acorn mast production, occurring about every two years, plays a critical role in driving their population dynamics [@sork1993].

*Q. rubra* currently faces many regeneration challenges in the northeastern US, and its recruitment may continue failing without timely and appropriate interventions. Oak-dominated forests are at their peak capacity to produce acorns at present; however, if forest aging continued for the next 50 years without sufficient regeneration to maintain its age structure, a population bottleneck may ensue [@dey2014]. Acorns have become a major hard mast source for wildlife consumption since the demise of American chestnut, but their production declines in older stands [@mcewan2006]. Weevils can also make the acorns non-viable before they are fully mature. This high seed predation strongly limits successful advance regeneration outside of mast years [@mcsheaForestryMattersDecline2007]. Moreover, seedling root penetration into underlying soils can be hindered by thick litter layers and can result in long and weak stems. [@arthurRefiningOakFireHypothesis2012]. Even when seedlings are established, they risk getting eaten, especially by deer [@mcsheaForestryMattersDecline2007]. Deer browse impact is among the strongest predictors of regeneration abundance [@miller2023], and can weaken effects of disturbances like fire and large canopy gaps [@nuttle2013]. *Q. rubra* is also susceptible to some fungal pathogens later in its life cycle including *Bretziella fagacearum* and *Armillaria mellea*, which cause oak wilt and Armillaria root rot respectively. While the former disease is spread from tree to tree through root grafts and travels longer distances by sap beetles (*Nitidulidae*) and bark beetles (*Pseudopityophthorus spp.*), the latter grows parasitically on trees weakened by fire, drought, insects, or other diseases [@sander1990]. Lastly, its relative shade intolerance retards its seedling recruitment when there is insufficient light in the understory [@nowackiDemiseFireMesophication2008]. Seedling growth might be slow due to competition from more shade-tolerant species such as red maple (*Acer rubrum*) and American beech (*Fagus grandifolia*). 

@abramsFireDevelopmentOak1992 hypothesized that ground fire might be crucial for oak regeneration. Fire has been integral to upland oak systems in the eastern US for millennia, evidenced by the co-presence of charcoal and oak dominance. Pre-settlement fires occurred as a function of lightning strikes as well as native activities such as cooking, heating, seedbed preparation, hunting, ceramic manufacture, and communication [@nowacki2024]. European settlement continued the periodic burning; furthermore, they spent the first half of the 19^th^ clearing land for agriculture, then the second half abandoning such farmland. Abandoned fields quickly became white pine-dominated forests (*Pinus strobus*), which was promptly logged as timber. *Q. rubra* was released from the understory and became dominant in the mid-20^th^ century at last [@nowackiDemiseFireMesophication2008]. Oak recruitment, however, sharply declined shortly afterward as forests were becoming wetter and more shady. Implementation of aggressive federal fire suppression efforts, combined with land conversion and overgrazing legacy, started to promote forest mesophication. Mesic microenvironmental conditions in turn favored the regeneration of shade-tolerant species. This positive feedback loop shrinks suitable habitats for shade-intolerant, fire-adapted species like *Q. rubra* over time. Therefore, it has been argued that it is necessary to bring back fire in a controlled manner to reverse the feedback loop and restore the upland oak ecosystems [@abramsFireDevelopmentOak1992].

The other important consideration for oak regeneration is that *Q. rubra* distribution is projected to move further northward due to climate change [@petersClimateChangeTree2020]. Out of all *Quercus* species native to North America, it is the one with the most northern distribution. Previously, it was pushed southward to its modern-day distributions during the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition 34 million years ago due to a 3-5^o^C decrease in temperature at high latitudes [@hipp2018]. However, its potential distribution is now projected to increase substantially in New England by 2100, particularly in northern New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, under both representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 due to high adaptability to a changing climate [@peters2020]. This presents an opportunity for foresters, landowners, and scientists with an interest in introducing or increasing *Q. rubra* density as part of their species mix at or beyond its current range limit as a timber producing species using silvicultural strategies to better understand what limits its regeneration near its northern range limit. Adaptive silviculture can be implemented to ensure this seamless transition and contribute towards long-term resilience on the stand level [@nagel2017]. Adding another species like *Q. rubra* to the mix can increase an ecosystem's functional diversity, potentially stabilizing it and mitigating future stresses and disturbances such as drought impacts [@yuan2025]. Silvicultural methods range from different ways of thinning and artificial planting to prescribed burns and combinations of them. Since oaks are not of any distinctive commercial value until they reach a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 30 cm, regeneration strategies need to be lengthy processes to ensure its establishment, development of advanced regeneration to 1.4 m, and release [@desmarais1998]. Syncing forest operations with nature's timing is another important consideration. For example, it might be sensible to do shelterwood cutting, during which a portion of trees is removed uniformly over the plot, during bareground seasons to scarify the soil and bury acorns below the soil surface. Many previous studies have demonstrated that fire, alone or when combined with thinning, strengthens or re-establishes its dominance in different ecosystems through a combination of greater relative fire resistance and easing other regeneration limitations [@iverson2008; @granger2018; @bassett2020; @dee2022]. This study built on previous research and further explored prescribed fire's role in oak range expansion.

This study investigates whether prescribed fire promotes the recruitment of *Q. rubra* seedlings and improves their growth relative to other forest management practices. We studied six pairs of burn and control forest stands across the White Mountains ecoregion in New Hampshire, USA. Three pairs were intentionally harvested and prescribed burn treatments applied with the objective of improving oak regeneration. Two other pairs lack an oak seed source but can provide insights into northern hardwood regeneration dynamics following prescribed burns. The last pair were unmanaged and experienced a wildfire instead, making it a fitting comparison. We hypothesized that *Q. rubra* regenerates better in burn stands, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

# Methods

## Study sites

The selected pairs of burn and control forest stands for this study are located in the approximately 320,000-ha White Mountains National Forest (WMNF) in New Hampshire (USA), three of which are part of a novel landscape-scale project guided by the forest's Land and Resource Management Plan (1999-2005, [@usdaforestservice2005]) and implemented by the USFS over the past two decades (Appendix, Figures 1-4). They are paired by project and treatment date, with one stand harvested and the paired site harvested and burned (@tbl-pairs, @fig-map). One pair does not have any recent management history, but was sampled opportunistically following a wildfire that resulted in patchy mortality of canopy trees in a mature stand. The remaining two pairs at Bartlett Experimental Forest were burned rather opportunistically, as a way to study how a combination of clearcut and prescribed fire can impact overall vegetation regeneration. While there existed some *Q. rubra* seedlings in the surrounding forest stands and even burned acorns in the study stands, no seed source was present after the treatments. Mature trees were presumed to be harvested during the clearcuts.

## Field data collection

### Site characterization

In summer 2023, transects (50 -225 m long) were laid 30 to 50 m apart to sample the variety of light and soil conditions in each study stand. Along a transect is a series of 1 m² quadrats (hereafter referred to as “plots”) spaced 10 m apart from their centers. In total, there were 43 transects laid in 6 pairs of burn-control stands, amounting to 393 plots. Percent slope, aspect, microtopography, burn evidence, and Q. rubra litter presence were recorded for each plot. Slope was determined with a hypsometer and later validated with topography maps, and aspect with a compass. Microtopography was described qualitatively, and burn evidence at the plot scale was confirmed with charcoal presence under the litter layer. Surface cover was estimated in categories including bare soil, woody debris, leaf litter, and rock. Live vegetation cover below breast height was also estimated visually. Woody species with DBH smaller than 2 cm were identified and their stems counted.

In July-August 2024, leaf area index (LAI) measurements were made at the center of each plot as a metric of light availability. The LI-COR LAI-2200C Plant Canopy Analyzer was positioned at \~50 cm height to assess the light availability to seedlings. LAI data was then matched, calibrated, and analyzed using the LI-COR FV2200 software.

### Seedling measurements and sample collection

In summer 2023, any *Q. rubra* seedlings present in the 1 m^2^ plots were tagged, aged, measured for height (cm) and diameter at root collar (DRC, mm), and checked for evidence of herbivory and pathogen damage. In summer 2024, they were resurveyed twice, once in June and again in August, to quantify growth between the two growth seasons and within this season alone. At this time, we also counted the number of leaves and number of live and dead branches. Herbivory and pathogen damage were quantified percentage-wise as well as described qualitatively. 

Within a 5 m radius of each plot center, trees \>2 cm DBH were identified and measured. The number of *Q. rubra* seedlings was also counted. In summer 2024, seedling abundance was re-estimated twice, once at the beginning and again at the end of the season.

## Data visualization and analysis

Plot-level stem and seedling counts and basal areas were expressed per hectare. Box plot graphs of seedling counts and various abovementioned growth measurements as well as LAI measurements were also constructed. Suitable statistical analyses, mostly analysis of variance (ANOVA) with blocking, were carried out in R version 4.4.0 for each response variable to test for hypothesized differences between prescribed fire and control pairs. Response variables included LAI values, seedling density, DRC, extension growth, and number of leaves. Data visualization and analysis packages included `forcats`, `ggplot2`, `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `gt`, `car`, `rstatix`, and `ggpubr`.

# Results

## Stand characterization

In the understory of the burned stands, *Q. rubra* mainly competes with early successional seedlings e.g. raspberries (*Rubus spp.*), *A. rubrum*, yellow birch (*Betula alleghaniensis*) and stump sprouts e.g. *F. grandifolia* (@fig-understory). *Rubus* is prevalent in all but Pair 4, ranging from 14000 stems per hectare in Pair 5 to 102000 stems ha^-1^ in Pair 6. *A. rubrum* was abundant only among Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and is more abundant in burned stands than in control stands e.g., with a stem density of 57000 ha^-1^ in the former versus 40000 in the latter in Pair 1. *B. alleghaniensis* follows a similar pattern while *F. grandifolia* is most common in Pair 4, especially the burned stand with 17000 stems ha^-1^ compared to 2000 in the control stand.

Study stands' basal areas are a reflection of their harvesting methods more than whether or not they were burned (@fig-overstory). Having been clearcut more recently and hence absent of trees of 20 cm and above in DBH, Pairs 5 and 6 have effectively zero basal area compared to others with 18.3 (burned stand in Pair 2) to 37.9 m^2^ (burned stand in Pair 1). Their compositions are also the least diverse, consisting of cherries (*Prunus*), aspens (*Populus*), and *Betula spp*. The remaining stands have a significant presence of mature *Q. rubra* as well as *Acer* and *Betula* *spp*. of mid-ranged DBH classes. Additionally, Pair 1's overstory composition includes a large basal area of high-DBH *P. strobus*, though only made up by a few individual trees. *Q. rubra*'s basal areas averaged 11±2 m^2^/ha across all stands, far exceeding those of other dominant genera (Appendix, Table 1). More standing dead trees were recorded in the burned stands, with *F. grandifolia* suffering the highest mortality rate (43% of basal area occupied by dead trees).

## *Q. rubra* seedling density and measurements in the field

A significant portion of living seedlings in 2023 germinated in at least the 3 years following the burns; pair 1 specifically experienced five years of substantially more germination in the burned stand versus the control stand (@fig-germination). Seedling density in 2023 was three times greater in burned stands (2887±240 per ha) than in control stands (1030±154 per ha, p\<0.001) (@fig-merged a). Seedlings in burned stands also grew better than in control stands, evidenced by greater DRC in 2023 (4.6±0.3 mm versus 3.3±0.3 mm, p\<0.01) (@fig-merged b), greater extension growth in 2024 (6.43±0.5 cm versus 2.6±0.4 cm, p\<0.001) (@fig-merged c), and more leaves sprouted (16±1 versus 7±1, p\<0.001) (@fig-merged d).

# Discussion

## *Q. rubra* seedling recruitment promoted by prescribed fire

*Q. rubra* regeneration can be promoted by prescribed burns at any and all critical life stages including acorn production, germination, establishment, seedling development, and release into canopy [@arthurRefiningOakFireHypothesis2012]. First of all, oak mother trees survive fire better than their mesophytic competitors (Appendix, Table 1) with thicker barks and rapid compartmentalization [@deyReviewDynamicsPrescribed2018]. Only 3% of *Q. rubra*'s basal area in 2023 was made up by dead standing mature trees, as opposed to 43% by dead *F. grandifolia* individuals. They hence have a time advantage to continue reproducing while their competition took time to regrow. Moreover, there is evidence that acorn production is positively correlated to tree vigor i.e full-crowned dominant trees of larger DBHs produce more acorns [@bogdziewicz2020]. Even though acorn production is also dependent on tree genetics [@smith2022], meaning that “good” producers are more likely to yield larger crops, thinning and burning to release the healthiest-looking individuals raises the chance of achieving better yields. This is in line with the shelterwood and seed tree cuttings in Pairs 1-3, where management left behind mostly *Q. rubra* trees in the highest DBH size classes, 30 cm and above (@fig-overstory).

In terms of acorn germination success, fire is assumed to decrease acorn herbivory, which can lead to nonviable seeds or low-vigor seedlings, by interfering with insects’ life cycle portions spent in the soil [@riccardi2004]. For example, weevils (*Conotrachelus spp.* and *Curculio spp.*) and could be killed by fire while exiting from fallen acorns or while in the forest floor layers attempting to reach the soil. Fire consumption of the forest floor removes their hiding areas and presents them to greater predation by small mammals. Another benefit fire provides is lessening the litter thickness and increasing bare soil surfaces, which in turns aids root penetration and avoids long and weak stems growing through thick litter [@hutchinson2024]. Percent bare soil in this study, however, did not correlate with seedling density at the plot scale (Appendix, Figure 5). We also explored whether interactions between fire and microtopography affected *Q. rubra* regeneration. For example, acorn accumulation may occur in a concave microsite and increase the germination probability here. However, the concave microsite can also gather germination barriers like leaf litter and rain water. Fire can help consume litter and alleviate the soil moisture, but no patterns of advantage were observed in the burned stands (Appendix, Figure 6).

While no pre-treatment data exists for this study to directly answer the question of whether burned stands experienced larger acorn yields or greater germination rates, the majority of the living *Q. rubra* seedlings in 2023 germinated in the 3-5 years following the burn events (@fig-germination). Furthermore, the seedling density in burned stands itself is nearly triple that in control stands, supporting the hypothesis that prescribed fire promotes seedling recruitment (@fig-merged a). One of the potential mechanisms of accelerating this recruitment is altered soil resource supply by fire. Fire increases gross nitrogen mineralization rate, which in turns releases more of it into the soil [@chapin2012]. A sudden increase in nitrogen availability in the nitrogen-limited temperate forest [@vadeboncoeur2010] may help promote flowering and acorn production [@callahan2008]. However, fire decreases microbial nitrate immobilization and subsequently inhibit nitrate retention [@su2022]. As a result, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions rise following a burn and become lost permanently from the ecosystem rather than being tightly recycled in decomposition [@stephens2023]. While such emissions tend to last under a year, nitrogen loss by leaching can persist in the long term and up to a 308% rate of change [@zhu2024]. Our study burns were already at least two years old at the time of data collection, except for the wildfire in pair 4 that had occurred the previous year. Regardless, the short term increases in ammonium concentrations in the soils seemed to have diminished for all but pairs 2 and 6 (Appendix, Figure 7). Nitrate concentrations are minimal compared to ammonium, but they were similar for both burned and control stands across all pairs, signaling that leaching might not be of great concern in this ecosystem (Appendix, Figure 8).

## *Q. rubra* seedling growth promoted by prescribed fires

Diameter at root collar, extension growth, and number of leaves were significantly greater for *Q. rubra* seedlings in burned stands versus control stands (@fig-merged b, c, d). While mesophytic competitors experience dieback and invest their resources in regrowing, *Q. rubra* seedlings make use of the increased nutrients, space, and light (@fig-lai) to grow taller vertically and horizontally as well as produce leaves to expedite photosynthesis. Additionally, they might have grown better by taking advantage of the temporary increases up to a year since the burn events in available nitrogen pools [@wan2001] and fluxes [@wang2014] immediately after fires to store carbon into the stems. On the other hand, the significantly larger annual extension growths and leaf production in the past two summers imply that the positive fire effects still linger 3-7 years post-treatment.

It is also worth evaluating fire effects on competitors at the germination and seedling establishment stage. Fire can reduce seed bank abundance [@schuler2010], but it is more likely that the seed bank remains abundant, especially in cases where the burn was of low or patchy intensity. In the understory, early successional seedlings are plentiful, mostly comprising *Rubus spp.*, *A. rubrum*, and *Betula spp.* (@fig-understory). *Rubus* seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals that survive in the soil when buried [@zasada2008]. The latter two do not survive well in the soil when a prescribed burn takes place but, if mother trees survived the fire, or if they are present near the edge of the burned unit, they are capable of producing high volumes of wind-dispersed seeds that germinate well in the postfire exposed mineral soil [@walters1990, @erdmann1990]. On the other hand, acorns neither survives in the soil for multiple years nor disperse far [@sander1990]. Nevertheless, *Q. rubra* has comparably strong basal sprouting responses following the death of the main stem, much like *A. rubrum* and *F. grandifolia* [@tubbs1990].

Prescribed burns can only be considered an effective management tool for *Q. rubra* regeneration if their effects are net positive. This means doing less damage to our target species than its existing competitors, and promote its regeneration over them. Our study demonstrates such positive effects for both oak recruitment and establishment near its northern range limit in North America and affirms prescribed fire as a potentially beneficial silvicultural management tool in introducing the species north of its current distribution and ensuring forest resiliency in time of climate change. The study, nevertheless, can become more meaningful when belowground variables are explored. *Q. rubra* is known to allocate more resources belowground in the first few years than aboveground [@kolb1990]. While destructive harvesting of seedlings lies outside of this project, their belowground structures would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of what role fire plays in this resource allocation. Other mechanisms at play, especially fire-soil interactions, can further illuminate how fire influences nutrient pools and fluxes as well as mycorrhizal fungal colonization and soil microbial communities. Lastly, while this study only discusses seed-based regeneration, *Q. rubra* also possesses prolific sprouting capabilities. Coppicing regeneration generally remains a research gap [@liu2025], and developing a systematic comparison between the two mechanisms will provide a more comprehensive picture of its regeneration potential in the ecosystem.
